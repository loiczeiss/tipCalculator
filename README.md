## My process

I started by creating the HTML structure and CSS-ed it into a beatiful mobile workflow.
I, then, worked on the responsitivity.
I prefer using tailwind but I want to be versatile so I used raw CSS to both structure and design the page.
I made sure everything was looking like the design proposed and then I worked on the math logics. When the logics were sound, I work on the behaviors, making it user friendly and intuitive.
A few tests later, it was all done and ready to use.
